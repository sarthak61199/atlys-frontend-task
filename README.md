## Notes

- The value in the output has been trunctated to 1 decimal point in case the output is not a whole number.
- ResizeObserver has also been used so that lines can adjust to any window resizing.
- As the requirement was also for a input validation, if the input is anything except "x" or any operators, the user won't be able to type.
